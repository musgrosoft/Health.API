# Health.API

This is an API that I use to import Health data into a SQL Server database.

Data is imported from Withings (Weight, % Fat Body Mass, and Blood Pressure), from Fitbit (Resting Heart Rate and Sleep Data), and from Google Sheets (Exercise data).

I then use a Grafana dashboard to display the data.
